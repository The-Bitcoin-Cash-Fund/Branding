# Bitcoin Cash Sound Branding
## Market Need
Decentralised systems by nature are difficult to unify in branding, this does not
mean it is impossible though, especially if the participants and market leaders
can rally behind a valuable idea. All businesses know that a strong and unified
brand is far more effective in the market than confused branding.  

Bitcoin Cash, to a certain extent, suffers from confused branding due to its nature as a hard fork of Bitcoin. While the community works through the visual branding issues, there is an opportunity to unify branding in a unique and powerful way that has not been applied on any other cryptocurrency.  

## Proposal

We propose implementing a unified sound branding for Bitcoin Cash payments and promotion across the ecosystem.  

This concept was developed from the extremely positive response to the Bitcoin Cash logo animation we produced. You can see this animation at...

The sound design done on this original animation was not a key focus, so we decided to dedicate some extra resources to developing a similar, but more refined sound that can be adopted across the industry.  

The concept of this sound branding it to amplify the bitcoin cash brand to the user and to the people around the user who become aware a bitcoin cash transaction has been made. The sound should have a similar psychological effect that Apple used on all of their macbooks when they are turned on.

The sound is instantly recognizable to the user and all around them, and continually reinforces the brand.  

To reinforce the brand further, the Bitcoin Cash Fund will be using the sound and logo animation in all promotional videos we create and fund, including videos ads, educational videos, live discussions etc.

## Development
We hired an industry leading audio team to develop this sound branding. You can see their work here:

We worked with them to explore and research many different sound concepts.  

What we found was that, although more extravagant and detailed sounds were more interesting to begin with, they quickly became annoying and distracting. We discovered that it was important that the sound remained simple and short, yet recogniseable. Our specifications for the sound were:  

- Modern,
- Digital,
- Noticeable,
- Payment,
- Fun,
- Positive,
- Fast,
- Short,
- Money,
- Recognisable,
- Not annoying after hearing 100s of times,
- Sounds the same across wide range of devices,
  
## Application
The sound is divided in two parts. The first part is used to signify the sending of a payment. This sound is the flicking of a coin (without a landing sound). This sound is to be played on a device that sends a Bitcoin Cash payment.  
  
The second part of the sound is a synthetic two tone sound which signifies receiving a payment. This sound is to be played on a device when a Bitcoin Cash payment is received. We have copies of the sounds as high bitrate OGG files and lower bitrate WAV files for implementing into apps.
